crystal documentation
=====================

`crystal` is a python module to assign significance to clusters of
correlated data. The most likely use-case is for methylation data, but
it can be use for any correlated data.

New users should check-out the introductory IPython notebook `here <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/brentp/crystal/blob/master/notebooks/Introduction.ipynb>`
